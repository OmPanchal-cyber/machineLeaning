In this particular project, we are using the insurance.csv dataset that contains information like age, sex, bmi, children, smoker, region, charges etc. and using that to predict insurance charges. 
However, before you go ahead and make a prediction, it is advised that you first pre-process the data, since it may contain some irregularities and noise. 
In addition, try various tricks and techniques in order to gain the best accuracy in your predictions.
